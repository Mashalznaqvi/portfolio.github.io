Just as every person's healthcare journey is unique, so too are the pathways to forging connections. Our goal is to make it easier for people to find new friends and exciting events, adapting to their specific needs during these challenging times.

      <h4>The Methodology
      </h4>
      <p>We selected 4 participants :
         The participants of our applications were university students,from different streams, the participants are approx. 20 years to 35 years old. Two of them were from Asia & the other from Europe.
         Finalising the participant and scheduling an online call with them.<br>
      </p>
         <h5>Steps:</h5>
         <p>
         <br>Introduction about the application and the experiment
         <br>Filling out the consent form
         <br> Giving them the document of the 5 action sequence instructions
         <br> Observe the participant performing all the Tasks
         <br> Completing the participant questionnaire.
         <br> Conducting the semi-structured interview and recording the data.
         <br> Conducting NASA TLX questionnaire.</p>
         <h5>The Process</h5>
         <p>
         <br>We used Google Meet for Video Call & the screen was shared in the call.The user would get the screen access so that he/she can control the flow of the app. Then we asked users the interview questions and filled the answers in our Google Docs as we went ahide.
         <br><br>due to the pandemic situation we held either a video call in which we shared the screen and the users were given access to go through the prototype or we did in person maintaining physical distance (and taking other precautions). After the tasks were done we asked them the interview question and the tasks feedback and noted their responses.
         </p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
         What motivates users to attend local or virtual events during the pandemic?
         <br>
How do users currently discover events in their area, and what challenges do they face?
<br>
What information do users consider essential when deciding to attend an event during the pandemic?

  <h4>Findings</h4>
 <ul>
   <li> Around 75 % of participants enjoyed exploring the app and found it interactive and innovative.</li>
   <li>Around 80 % of the participants found the app easy to use, they were able to perform the main functionality of the app and easily access the features of the app without any assistance.</li>
   <li>They also claimed that it was easy for them to redirect to pages and explore the app.</li>
   <li> A few users had difficulty in going back to the previous page from where they were
      redirected and had to close the app to reach the desired page.</li>
      <li> Users found the icons familiar and easy.</li>
      <li> They could relate and recall the icons and images commonly used in usual apps that
      they use</li>
      <li> There should have been tooltips in the app somewhere to create ease for the user.</li>
      <li> There should have been a back button in all screens of app to eliminate chances of
      users being stuck at some point.</li>
      <li> There should have been searching options in all data / chat-related screens.</li>
      <li> There should have been a privacy reated option in the app to show/hide posts from people/groups.</li>

         According to potential user it is eay to reach the Feed & News screen by the bottom navigation given in all screens of application the interests of users are already saved when user signup very first time so the app don‚Äôt ask every time for interests, although user can edit interests manually by themselves.
         </li>
         <br>
         <li>Explore screen (Story Board) Feedback:
         It is observed by actual users that it is good soure of information that we get from the Mind Alike app ‚Äúexploring‚Äù functionality, because most of the things about which we are unaware that are new in market or newly invented so by using exploring functionality of this app, we get aware of new games, melodies, dresses, current fashion, songs and much more by typing in search bar.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Jam (Story Board) Feedback:
         It is observed that ‚ÄúJAM‚Äù functionality of the application is the most popular and most of our downloads of app are because of this module in our application this module boost our app downloads, because in this current situation even it‚Äôs a Christmas and new year we are totally in our home and got nothing to do social type, so JAM functionality is liked by every user of our app.</li>

     <h5>Industry Takeaways</h5>
     <p>In the realm of virtual socialization and friend matching, there exists a dynamic landscape that offers opportunities for innovation even within the constraints of the pandemic. While safety and privacy considerations are paramount, a thoughtful balance between facilitating meaningful connections and adhering to safety protocols can lead to the creation of engaging, user-centric experiences. Moreover, it's vital not to prematurely dismiss innovative ideas; evaluating them within the context of user safety and privacy can lead to advancements that reshape the industry's approach to socialization and connection-building.</p>
     <h5>Personal Takeaways</h5>
     <p>I've learned that in user research, providing users with moments to digest information is crucial. This approach can improve the quality of data gathered and make the research process more user-centric.<br><br>he use of sketched storyboards and hi-fi components has proven to be a powerful tool for conveying the context of certain features without the need for a complete build-out. This method allows for efficient communication of ideas and context, reducing the time and resources required for full development.</p>
